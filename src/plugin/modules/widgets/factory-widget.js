/*
 * DOC: Sample Factory Pattern Widget
 * 
 * Follows a factory pattern for generation of widgets.
 * The module returns factory-maker - a function which returns a factory for making 
 * widgets.
 * The factory has a single method - makeWidget.
 * The widget it produces has the following methods:
 * init
 * attach
 * start
 * run
 * stop
 * detach
 * destroy
 */

/* DOC: dependencies
 * This sample widget has only a single explicit dependency - the q promises library.
 * At this stage of the widget lifecycle each method must be implemented as a
 * promise. This allows the widget to incorporate asynchronous processes into 
 * any method.
 * 
 * We use the well-established "Q" promises library. Since promises is really
 * an interface, it would be possible to use another promises library, or 
 * even to roll your own.
 * 
 * We also use our own lightweight DOM wrapper, kb.dom. This allows us to prevent
 * access to the global DOM objects.
 * 
 * Of course, one may wish to use jquery to do the same thing.
 * 
 * TODO: I think we need one more dependency -- a kbase dom helper, so that
 * TODO: widget authors don't need to deal with "document", "window" or other
 * TODO: global dom objects. This is also more consistent with the spirit of AMD - 
 * TODO: ban all globals. It also gives us a hook on to a more secure widget env,
 * TODO: as well as widget testing (via mocks for the DOM).

    * In this example widget we are using the factory pattern to create

    * a clear api in the form of the final returned simple object.
    * 
    * The constructor may take arguments, to assist in the creation of a 
    * specialized widget. In this simple widget we do not utilize this
    * feature. However, the sample jquery and pure object widgets do, 
    * in the form of the widget adapter.
